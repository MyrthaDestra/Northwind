# Northwind Foods Sales Dashboard

Northwind Foods SQL &amp; Tableau Dashboard

This data analytics project focuses on the preparation and visualization of sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictional food supplier. The Maven Analyticsâ€™ Northwind Traders Dataset was utilized for this purpose. The dataset encompasses detailed information about sales, orders, customers, products, shippers, and employees.

To begin, I established a SQL database to store the dataset and employed SQL queries to extract valuable insights and address critical business inquiries. A comprehensive sales report was generated using SQL, serving as the foundation for the creation of a visually compelling Tableau dashboard.

The primary objective of this project repository is to provide a clear demonstration of my expertise and proficiency in utilizing Tableau and SQL.
